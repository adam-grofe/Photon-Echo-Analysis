# Photon-Echo-Analysis
This is an analysis program written in Fortran 90 to compute the two dimensional photon echo spectrum from a set of frequencies computed from a molecular dynamics trajectory. This program uses the openMP library to perform parallelization.

The program can be compiled using the makefile.


The program was written accoding to the following reference.
